# mypy-PyCharm-plugin

The plugin provides a simple terminal to run fast mypy daemon
from PyCharm with a single click or hotkey and easily navigate
through type checking results. The idea of the mypy terminal is
different from the normal PyCharm type checking that highlights
the errors in a current file. The mypy terminal shows errors in
all files in your project (even in those not currently open).
Also mypy provides a bit stricter type checking and is tunable
by various flags and config settings.

## Installation steps

The plugin requires [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) to be installed.

1. Download [mypy-plugin/mypy-plugin.jar](https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-PyCharm-plugin/blob/master/mypy-plugin/mypy-plugin.jar?raw=true)
2. In PyCharm go to Preferences -> Plugins -> Install plugins from disc
   -> Select downloaded file -> Restart PyCharm when prompted.
3. After restart you should find the plugin in View -> Tool windows
   -> Mypy terminal

## Configuration

Normally, plugin should not require any configuration steps. However,
sometimes plugin cannot find `dmypy` command because it doesn't have
the full environment. If the plugin says something like
`/bin/bash: dmypy command not found` when you try to run mypy,
then this is likely the cause. In this case right click in mypy
terminal in PyCharm -> Configure plugin. Then enter the path where
mypy is installed as PATH suffix. If you are using a virtual environment,
thih would look like `/my/project/bin`. If necessary, you can also
configure mypy command to use your custom `.ini` file and flags.

## Usage

You can pin the terminal to either side of PyCharm window: click
on window toolbar → Move. The current default is bottom, which
works best if you typically have only a few errors. If you are
working on legacy code with many mypy errors, you may want to use
the ‘left’ or ‘right’ setting. Finally, if you have multiple
monitors you might find the floating mode convenient.

Currently supported features and keyboard shortcuts:

- Show/hide mypy terminal:  `Ctrl + Shift + X`
- Run mypy type checking:  `Ctrl + Shift + M` or click Run
- Go to error: click on error line, or use `Ctrl + Shift + <arrows>`
  to navigate between errors
- Copy current error: right click → Copy error text,
  or `Ctrl + Shift + C`
- Collapse/expand errors: click on file name in the mypy terminal,
  or `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` when a file name is selected
- Sometimes mypy shows links to online documentation; to follow
  links use `Alt + <click>`
